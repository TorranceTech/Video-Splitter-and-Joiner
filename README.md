# Video-Splitter-and-Joiner
This Python script allows you to split a video into multiple parts and then join them back together. It was created with the intention of handling long videos, splitting them without loss of quality. In addition, it offers several options to customize the process, including changing the video format, time interval, output directory, and video ratio. You can choose standard ratios for TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram.

### Features
Split Videos: You can drag and drop a video file into the CLI and the script will split the video into 10-second segments (this can be changed through the menu). 
The video segments will be saved in a folder on the desktop.
Join Videos: The script can also join multiple video segments into a single video.
Customization: You can customize the video format, the time interval for splitting, the output directory, and the video ratio. Standard ratios for TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram are available.

## Examples of videos ratios:
- TikTok: 9:16
- YouTube: 16:9
- Instagram (square): 1.1
